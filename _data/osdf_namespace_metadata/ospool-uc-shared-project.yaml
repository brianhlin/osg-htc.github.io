  Staging area for [PATh](https://path-cc.io/)-operated collaboration services located at the University of Chicago.

  The PATh project allows multi-institutional collaborations to stage their experimental data
  and simulation outputs to an object store connected to the OSDF and then process and analyze the data using
  the OSDF via the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/ospool) or other capacity dedicated to their
  experiment.

  This data is organized as "working datasets" representing running workloads, not
  permanent scientific outputs.
