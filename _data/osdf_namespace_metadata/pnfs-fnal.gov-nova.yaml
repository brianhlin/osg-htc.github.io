  The NOvA (NuMI Off-axis ve Appearance) experiment is shedding light on one of nature's most elusive particles: neutrinos.
  Since the late 1990s, physicists have known that neutrinos exhibit a quantum mechanical behavior called oscillations. But
  this behavior is not predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. NOvA is working to better understand these strange
  particles through precision measurements of their oscillation properties.

  NOvA uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.
