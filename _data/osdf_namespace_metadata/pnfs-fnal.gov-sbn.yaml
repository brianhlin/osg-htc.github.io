  The international Short-Baseline Neutrino Program at Fermilab examines the properties of neutrinos,
  specifically how the flavor of a neutrino changes as it moves through space and matter. The program
  emerged from a joint proposal, submitted by three scientific collaborations, to use particle detectors
  to perform sensitive searches for ve appearance and νμ disappearance in the Booster Neutrino Beam. All
  of the detectors are types of liquid-argon time projection chambers, and each contributes to the
  development of this particle detection technology for the long-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiments
  (DUNE).
