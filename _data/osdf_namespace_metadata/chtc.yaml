  The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), established in 2006, aims to
  bring the power of High Throughput Computing to all fields of research, and to
  allow the future of HTC to be shaped by insight from all fields.

  Beyond technologies and innovation and HTC through projects like
  [HTCondor](https://htcondor.org), the CHTC operates general purpose clusters for
  the UW-Madison campus.  CHTC allows researchers to stage their research data
  to an object store connected to the OSDF and then process and analyze the data using
  the OSDF with on-campus resources or the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/ospool).

  This data is organized as "working datasets" representing running workloads, not
  permanent scientific outputs.
