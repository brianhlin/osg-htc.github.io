  Staging area for [PATh](https://path-cc.io/)-operated Access Points located at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

  The PATh project allows researcher teams to stage their research data
  to an object store connected to the OSDF and then process and analyze the data using
  the OSDF via the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/ospool).  Any US-based open science team
  can utilize the PATh services for distributed High Throughput Computing workflows.

  This data is organized as "working datasets" representing running workloads, not
  permanent scientific outputs.
