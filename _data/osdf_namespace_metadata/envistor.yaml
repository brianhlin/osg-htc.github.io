  The South Florida region is home to nearly 10 million people, and the population is growing. The region faces several challenges,
  such as rising sea levels and flooding, harmful algae blooms, water contamination, and wildlife habit loss, which affects the economy
  and the welfare of its population. Florida International University (FIU) runs the EnviStor project, which is a centrally managed,
  petabyte-scale storage system that is also a clearing house for supporting interdisciplinary research and modeling involving both built
  and natural environments in South Florida. EnviStor provides opportunities for students
  and faculty to enhance their knowledge of database management, focusing on interoperability.

  The datasets kept in EnviStor can be accessed via the OSDF; work is ongoing to provide new computing workflows and AI-based dataset
  discovery that will help users utilize the data.
