  The RouteViews dataset provides a map of the Internet, as seen by participating
  sites.  The information, collected from the [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol)
  tables of routers, includes both current and historic "snapshots".  This allows
  operators of major Internet services to detect changes to the map in near-real
  time and for researchers to understand the historical evolution of the Internet.

  The RouteViews dataset is funded by University of Oregon's
  [Advanced Network Technology Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20200428083158/http://antc.uoregon.edu/),
  and by grants from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/),
  [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com/), the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency](https://www.darpa.mil/),
  [Juniper Networks](https://www.juniper.net/), Sprint Advanced Technology Laboratories,
  [Catchpoint](https://catchpoint.com/) and the providers who graciously provide their BGP views.
