  The RouteViews dataset provides a map of the Internet, as seen by participating
	sites.  The information, collected from the [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol)
	tables of routers, includes both current and historic "snapshots".  This allows
	operators of major Internet services to detect changes to the map in near-real
	time and for researchers to understand the historical evolution of the Internet.

	The RouteViews dataset is funded by University of Oregon's
	[Advanced Network Technology Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20200428083158/http://antc.uoregon.edu/),
	and by grants from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/),
	[Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com/), the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency](https://www.darpa.mil/),
	[Juniper Networks](https://www.juniper.net/), Sprint Advanced Technology Laboratories,
	[Catchpoint](https://catchpoint.com/) and the providers who graciously provide their BGP views.
