  The [LLC4320 ocean dataset](https://ecco-group.org/world-of-ecco.htm) is
  the product of a 14-month simulation of ocean circulation and dynamics
  using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's General Circulation
  Model on a lat-lon-cap grid. Comprising extensive scalar data such as
  temperature, salinity, heat flux, radiation, and velocity, the dataset
  exceeds 4 PB and can potentially improve our understanding of global ocean
  circulation and its role in Earth's climate system.

  In order to make this dataset more accessible and easier to visualize, the
  [National Science Data Fabric](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org/) has
  processed the raw data into the [ViSUS](https://visus.org/) data format
  using their [OpenViSUS](https://github.com/sci-visus/OpenVisus) toolsuite.
