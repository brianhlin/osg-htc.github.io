  The Sage project provides a platform for AI computing at the edge.  It operates
  a nationwide infrastructure of distributed sensors - from urban landscapes to remote
  mountainsides - that collect, process using AI techniques, and aggregate data.

  With over 100 Sage nodes deployed across 17 states, including fire-prone regions in
  the Western U.S., the platform supports rapid-response science and sustained observation
  of ecological systems, agriculture, urban environments, and weather-related hazards.

  Sage uploads its data into NSF CC* funded storage systems connected to the OSDF.  Data
  access requires a Sage account; more information can be found in [the Sage documentation](https://sagecontinuum.org/docs/tutorials/accessing-data) and tutorials.
