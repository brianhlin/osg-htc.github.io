  [GlueX](http://www.gluex.org) is an experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
  Facility (JLab) in Newport News, Virginia, that studies how particles called mesons behave
  to learn more about the strong forceâ€”the force that holds atomic nuclei together. The dataset
  from GlueX comes from millions of collisions between high-energy photons and protons.  GlueX
  uses the OSDF to distribute inputs to its data simulations and is exploring using OSDF for
  reprocessing.

  GlueX is supported by the US Department of Energy.
