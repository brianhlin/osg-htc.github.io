  The [NASA C1440-LLC2160 dataset](https://data.nas.nasa.gov/geoseccoviz/geoseccovizdata/c1440_llc2160/GEOS/)
  is [the simulation output from research into coupling two models](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/SC21/research/project16.html):
  a global atmospheric model and a global ocean model that were originally
  designed to be run separately. The atmospheric model is a C1440
  configuration of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric
  model running on a cubed-sphere grid. The global ocean model is an LLC2160
  configuration of the MITgcm model that uses a latlon-cap grid. Each model
  was run for over 10000 hourly timesteps covering over 14 simulation
  months. With more than 10000 time steps and multiple scalar fields, it
  totals approximately 1.8 PB.

  In order to make this dataset more accessible and easier to visualize, the
  [National Science Data Fabric](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org/) has
  processed the raw data into the [ViSUS](https://visus.org/) data format
  using their [OpenViSUS](https://github.com/sci-visus/OpenVisus) toolsuite.
