  The Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) is a 112-ton active mass liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC)
  neutrino detector that sits only 110-m from the target of the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab. SBND is
  the near detector in the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program. ICARUS is the far detectors in the program, and
  MicroBooNE ran previously in the same beam.

  SBND will record over a million neutrino interactions per year. By providing such a high statistics measurement
  of the un-oscillated content of the BNB, SBND plays a critical role in performing searches for neutrino oscillations
  at the SBN Program. The large data sample will also allow studies of neutrino-argon interactions in the GeV energy
  range with unprecedented precision. The physics of these interactions is an important element of future neutrino
  experiments that will employ the LArTPC technology, such as the long-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, DUNE.
