  The [Fusion Data Platform](https://github.com/Fusion-Data-Platform/fdp) (FDP) provides
  a modern, Python-based data framework for analyzing data from magnetic fusion experiments.

  Using data from the [DIII-D National Fusion Facility](https://www.ga.com/magnetic-fusion/diii-d),
  users can leverage the FDP software to stream data via the OSDF services for their fusion data
