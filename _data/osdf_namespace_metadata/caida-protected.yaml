  The Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) runs an "Network Telescope", collecting
  packets sent to a cross-section of the public Internet similarly to how a telescope collects stray
  light.

  This dataset is made available to scientists attempting to understand how activity, such as malware,
  is moving across the Internet.

  The CAIDA integration with OSDF aims to stage the most recent subset of the recorded data to be
  made available for large-scale analysis.
