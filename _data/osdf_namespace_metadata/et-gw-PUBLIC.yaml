  Simulation data used for the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge.

  The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed next-generation gravitational wave
  observatory, aiming to detect gravitational waves with much higher
  sensitivity than either the LIGO or VIRGO instruments.

  As part of the studies and the design proposal for the ET instrument, the
  mock data challenge was run in 2024 to better understand how the future data
  may be distributed and analyzed.
