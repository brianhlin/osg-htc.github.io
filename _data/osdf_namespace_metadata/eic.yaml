  The Electron-Ion Collider is a proposed facility being built at
  the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Experiments at the facility
  include the ePIC detector.  The computing for EIC is a joint collaboration
  with the [Jefferson National Lab](https://www.jlab.org/eic); the datasets
  connected to the OSDF include input files and other information necessary
  to help with simulations of the detector's behavior.
