  Jessica Kendall-Bar leads a research group that integrates engineering, data science, and ecology
  to explore the behavior and physiology of marine life.  The data stored on the OSDF includes high-resolution
  multimodal data such as video, GPS, and electrophysiology.

  The OSDF data is catalogued on the [National Data Platform](https://nationaldataplatform.org/), enabling
  textual, conceptual, and map-based spatiotemporal search capabilities.

  The NDP project is using this dataset as inputs for a data challenge planned for Fall 2025.  It also
  powers an application running on the [National Research Platform](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/)
  at <https://lifeinthedeep.nrp-nautilus.io/>.
