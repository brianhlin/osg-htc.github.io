  [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) provides a wide range of atmospheric and Earth system science datasets,
  including observational data from airborne and ground-based instruments, outputs from community weather
  models, and large-scale reanalysis and simulation data. These datasets support research on weather patterns,
  the water cycle, and extreme weather events. They are used by researchers, educators, and policymakers
  across the US.

  Integrated with the OSDF is NCAR's Research Data Archive (RDA), the centrally-managed archive of the laboratory's
  atmospheric and Earth systems datasets.  When downloading data from the web interface, users are automatically
  redirected to the OSDF cyberinfrastructure.

  Example notebooks that analyze data from these datasets can be found in the [NCAR OSDF Examples repository](https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples).

  The integration between NCAR and OSDF is part of the [Pathfinders collaboration](https://ndc-pathfinders.org),
  a collaboration between five initiatives aimed at developing science-led pathways through the NSF cyberinfrastructure
  landscape. This work is funded by NSF award [1852977](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1852977).
