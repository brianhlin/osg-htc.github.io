  Staging area for data used in the [PATh Facility](https://path-cc.io/facility/index.html).
  The PATh Facility is a distributed computing resource spanning 5 sites, from San Diego, California
  to Syracuse, New York, that provides NSF-funded researches with compute credits for High Throughput
  Computing workflows.

  This repository enables these NSF projects to stage their research data
  outputs to an object store connected to the OSDF and then process and analyze the data using
  the OSDF via both the PATh Facility computing hardware and the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/ospool).

  This data is organized as "working datasets" representing active workloads from researchers, not
  permanent scientific outputs.
