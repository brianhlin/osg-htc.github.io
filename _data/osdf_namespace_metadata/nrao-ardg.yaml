  Radio astronomy data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS).

  As written in the [VLASS homepage](https://public.nrao.edu/vlass/),
  VLASS is a survey of the universe through the use of the Very Large
  Array (VLA) in New Mexico. The VLA is one of the most sensitive telescopes
  in the radio band that can provide more sensitive images of the universe
  than any other radio telescope in the world. This, however, requires processing
  large volumes of data and super-computer class computing
  resources. The VLASS is designed to produce a large collection
  of radio data available to wide range of scientists within the astronomical
  community. VLASS's science goal is to produce a radio, all-sky survey that
  will benefit the entire astronomical community. As VLASS completes its three
  scans of the sky separated by approximately 32 months, new developments in
  data processing techniques will allow scientists an opportunity to download data
  instantly on potentially millions of astronomical radio sources.

  The data in this data origin consists of interferometric visibilities stored in 
  ([Measurement Set (MS)](https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html)) format. Each
  dataset contains calibrated visibilities for one of the sixteen spectral windows
  of the VLA and covers an area of 4 square degrees (2 degrees x 2 degrees) in the
  sky. All sixteen spectral windows are combined to generate a single image, so that
  the data contained in this data origin can be used to make images of approximately 
  70 regions in the sky, each image covering 4 square degrees. The [LibRA software
  package](https://github.com/ARDG-NRAO/LibRA) is used to transform visibilities to
  images. The architecture and design considerations for LibRA are shown in [this
  presentation](https://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~sbhatnag/Talks/For_BrianB.pdf).

  Teams of scientists at the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory
  (NRAO)](http://www.nrao.edu), Socorro, NM and the Center for High Throughput Computing
  (CHTC) have used the PATh and NRP facilities of the OSG to make the
  deepest image in the radio band of the Hubble Ultra-deep Field
  (HUDF).  Similarly, the COSMOS HI Large Extra Galactic Survey
  (CHILES)[http://chiles.astro.columbia.edu/] project has 1000 hr of integration with the VLA on the
  COSMOS field. Imaging the CHILES data using PATh and NRP facilities
  delivered the deepest radio image of this region of the sky, at an
  unmatched data processing throughput. Similarly to the VLASS data stored in this
  data origin, the data for HUDF and CHILES is stored in the PATh facility data origin.
  These recent large scale imaging achievements that were made possible through
  use of OSG resources are reported in this [NRAO Newsletter article]
  (https://science.nrao.edu/enews/17.3/index.shtml#deepimaging) and [this press
  release](https://public.nrao.edu/news/astronomers-study-the-universe-300-times-faster/).
