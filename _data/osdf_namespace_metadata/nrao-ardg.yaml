  Radio astronomy data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS).

  As written in the [VLASS homepage](https://public.nrao.edu/vlass/),
  VLASS is a survey of the universe through the use of the Very Large
  Array in New Mexico.  THe VLASS is designed to produce a large collection
  of radio data available to wide range of scientists within the astronomical
  community. VLASS's science goal is to produce a radio, all-sky survey that
  will benefit the entire astronomical community. As VLASS completes its three
  scans of the sky separated by approximately 32 months, new developments in
  data processing techniques will allow scientists an opportunity to download data
  instantly on potentially millions of astronomical radio sources.
