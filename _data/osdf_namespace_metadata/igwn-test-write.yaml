  This is a test origin utilized by staff of the [LIGO Laboratory](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) at
  Caltech to test new versions of origin software and configuration, to ensure that upcoming changes
  do not disrupt ongoing data analysis on any of the production origins. This test origin specifically
  tests the software and configuration of user-managed data analogous to that served in /igwn/cit.
