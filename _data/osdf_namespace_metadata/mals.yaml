  The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) consists of 1,655 hours of observatory time on the
  [MeerKAT](https://www.sarao.ac.za/science/meerkat/about-meerkat/) radio telescope at the South
  African Radio Astronomy Observatory.  The survey aims
  to carry out the most sensitive search of HI and OH absorption lines at 0<z<2,
  the redshift range over which most of the cosmic evolution in the star formation rate density takes place.

  The MALS dataset is replicated to the OSDF to allow collaborators at the [NRAO](https://public.nrao.edu/)
  participate in the scientific study of the data.
