  storage solution that can be used by University of Hawai'i faculty and staff.  KoaStore
  was [funded](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2022/10/21/500k-boosts-data-intensive-research/)
  through the [NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure]() program through [award #2232862](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2232862).
