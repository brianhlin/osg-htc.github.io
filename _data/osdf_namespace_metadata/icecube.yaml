  The **IceCube repository** integrates data from the [*IceCube Neutrino Observatory*](https://icecube.wisc.edu),
  a cubic-kilometer detector embedded deep in Antarctic ice near the South Pole. IceCube records when high-energy
  neutrinos interact with the ice. 
  
  Using over 5,000 optical sensors deployed between 1,450 and 2,450 meters below the surface, the observatory
  captures detailed information about these events, including their timing, location, and intensity. The data
  is used to study cosmic neutrinos and the astrophysical phenomena that produce them, such as **black holes**,
  **supernovae**, and **gamma-ray bursts**.
  
  The IceCube collaboration is supported by [multiple funding agencies](https://icecube.wisc.edu/collaboration/funding/) including
  the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2042807).  The dataset is maintained by the
  Wisconsin Icecube Particle Astrophysics Center.
