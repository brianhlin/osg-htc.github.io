  The ICARUS neutrino detector measures 65 feet long and weighs 760 tons. It began its life in Gran Sasso Laboratory in
  Italy, seeking out elusive particles using pioneering technology. It later spent two years undergoing upgrades at CERN,
  the European particle physics laboratory and home of the Large Hadron Collider. It moved to Fermilab in 2017 and was
  installed in its detector hall in 2018, where along with the new Cosmic Ray Tagger it forms the far detector for the
  Short-Baseline Neutrino program.
  
  The ICARUS collaboration is investigating signs of physics that may point to a new kind of neutrino called the sterile
  neutrino. Other experiments have made measurements that suggest a departure from the standard three-neutrino model. ICARUS
  is also investigating the various probabilities of a neutrino interacting with different types of matter as well as
  neutrino-related astrophysics topics.
