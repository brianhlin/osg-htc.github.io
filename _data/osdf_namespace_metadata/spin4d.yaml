  The [SPIn4D project](https://ifauh.github.io/SPIN4D/) (Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning)
  develops neural networks to help prepare for the huge amount of solar data coming
  from the NSF-funded [Inouye Solar Telescope](https://nso.edu/telescopes/inouye-solar-telescope/),
  the most powerful solar telescope in the world.

  SPIn4D's [data release one](http://dtn-itc.ifa.hawaii.edu/spin4d/DR1/) is 109TB of simulated small-scale dynamo
  actions accompanying the project's first paper.  A [corresponding Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ifauh/spin4d-data/blob/main/spin4d-data-exploration.ipynb)
  illustrates how to access and use the data via the OSDF using the [Pelican](https://pelicanplatform.org) clients.

  For more information, see the [accompanying spotlight article](https://pelicanplatform.org/news/2024/12/20/sun-secrets).
