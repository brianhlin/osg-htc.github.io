  MINERvA (Main Injector Neutrino ExpeRiment to study v-A interactions) is the first neutrino experiment in the
  world to use a high-intensity beam to study neutrino reactions with five different nuclei, creating the first
  self-contained comparison of interactions in different elements. While this type of study has previously been
  done using beams of electrons, this is a first for neutrinos.

  MINERvA is providing the world's best, high-precision measurements of neutrino interactions on various nuclei,
  in the 1-to 10-GeV energy range. MINERvA's results are being used as inputs to current and future experiments
  seeking to study neutrino oscillations, or the ability of neutrinos to change their type.
