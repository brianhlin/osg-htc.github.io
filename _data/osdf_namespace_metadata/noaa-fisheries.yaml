description: |
  NOAA collects and uses active acoustic (or sonar) data for a variety of
  mapping requirements. Water column sonar data focus on the area from near
  the surface of the ocean to the seafloor. Primary uses of these specific
  sonar data include 3-D mapping of fish schools and other mid-water marine
  organisms; assessing biological abundance; species identification; and
  habitat characterization. Other uses include mapping underwater gas seeps
  and remotely monitoring undersea oil spills. NCEI archives water column
  sonar data collected by NOAA line offices, academia, industry, and
  international institutions.
