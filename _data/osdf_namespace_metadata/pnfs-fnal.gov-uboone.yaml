  MicroBooNE is a large 170-ton liquid-argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino experiment located on the Booster
  neutrino beamline at Fermilab. The experiment first started collecting neutrino data in October 2015.

  MicroBooNE investigates the low energy excess events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment, measure a suite of low
  energy neutrino cross sections, and investigate astro-particle physics.

  MicroBooNE uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.
