  A century of suppressing wildfires has created a dangerous accumulation of flammable vegetation on landscapes,
  contributing to megafires that risk human life and destroy ecosystems. Prescribed burns can dramatically reduce
  the risk of large fires that are uncontrollable by decreasing this buildup of fuels. BurnPro3D is a science-driven,
  decision-support platform to help the fire management community understand risks and tradeoffs quickly and
  accurately when planning and conducting prescribed burns.
